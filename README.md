# A Python TBG
The Arse Game, in Python.

# The Arse Game
What is The Arse Game? The Arse Game is a game centerd around retarded people at my old school and a bunch of made up characters. Some of them include the following. <details><summary>CHARACTER SPOILERS!!</summary>SM, F, RW, and CD.</details>

The storyline of the whole game is made by my friend. Also the original game is on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), where I have the `.sb3` file but won't share it. (Because I'm likely to get banned.) Don't ask for it, it's not even done, heck, not even CLOSE to done, and it just plain sucks.

# TBG
TBG stands for "text-based game". The game only uses text (in this case it's using the terminal), so there isn't a single image. Not a single one. Basically, you don't even need a mouse to play this game.

## How to make a choice?
(I should not be typing this part.)

In every choice option, whether it's the menu, or an option in-game, you will see a list of options, shown using "(option 1; option 2; idk)". Just type in one of those, so if you're picking option one, type in "option 1" and press enter/return.

# ~~Installation (?)~~ / How to run
1. Download the latest one, the dates are in US form, MDY.
2. If you haven't already, download Python [here](https://python.org). Download and install the latest version.
3. Now, you can use any of these ways to run it.
1. Directly open it, (double click)
2. If you're using IDLE, open (`CTRL + O`) the file, and press `F5` or `Modules` > `Run`
3. Or you can use the command prompt way (`cd [file location]`, `python [file name]`)
